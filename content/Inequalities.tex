\section{Inequalities}

\subsubsection{Markov's Inequality}

Markov's Inequality. For a nonnegative random variable $X$ and positive $t$, we have:\\

$Pr[ X \geq \lambda ] \leq \frac{E[X]}{\lambda}$\\

\subsubsection{Chebyshev's Inequality}\\

We can use Markov's Inequality to derive Chebyshev's Inequality. \\

$Pr[ |X-\mathbb{E}(X)| \geq \lambda ] \leq \frac{ Var[X] }{\lambda^2}$\\
